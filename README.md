# COVID-19-Exploratory-Analysis-Using-SQL
This project focuses on the general overview of the COVID-19 pandemic and this was achieved using Microsoft SQL.
We'll be generating insights from two datasets that have information on global populations, cases, deaths, and vaccinations across various countries and continents.
These insights will be the foundation on which will be used to make data-driven decisions with respect to the pandemic.

## Queries
Queries were written using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. Below are some of the queries written that led to these findings:
1. Mortality rate: Identifying the countries that need immediate assistance with respect to deaths.
2. Total Cases Vs Total Deaths: This is in relation to the number of cases to the number of deaths for each day.
3. Total Cases Vs Total Death (Ghana): A deep dive to see the current situation in my country of origin.
4. Total Case Vs Population: This is in relation to the number of cases in each country to the total population, on a daily basis.
5. Highest Infection Count: Identifying the country with the highest infection count.
6. Highest Death Count: Identifying the country with the highest death count. This is to show the country with the highest mortality rate

The various techniques used in this project include joins, CTEs, Views, aggregate functions, and windows functions just to name a few.
These queries can be used for data analysis, visualization, and reporting as well.

The insights generated give use a general overview of the COVID-19 virus across continents and countries. These findings will help in the decision 
making process with respect to resource allocation, education of inhabitants, and other health-related strategies.
